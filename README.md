# In-Vehicle-Coupon-Recommendation-
In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation ML Project

Problem statement:
The given data was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passengers. It then asks whether the driver will accept the coupon.

We aim to build a classification model to predict whether the coupon will be accepted or not in various driving scenarios based on customer and situational features.
