In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation ML Project:<br>

Problem statement:<br>
The given data was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passengers. It then asks whether the driver will accept the coupon.

Objective:<br>
We aim to build a classification model to predict whether the coupon will be accepted or not in various driving scenarios based on customer and situational features.
